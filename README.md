# GreatReader - Krista Calleja's solution for the SheSharp and Troopl Hackathon Oct 2021

In October 2021 I attended my first hackathon, organised by [SheSharp](https://www.shesharp.co/) and [Troopl](https://troopl.com/). Together with tens of other coders from around the globe we met up online through Slack, Google Meets and via YouTube live videos to discuss the challenge, and our coding experiences.

## Overview

### The challenge

The Guidelines of the Hackathon required 
A successful project should were as follows:

- Generate supportive and/or inspirational messages (e.g. "You've got this!" or "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.") Please note that all messages should follow our Hackathon Code of Conduct.
- Display messages either on-demand (e.g. via button click, Twitter reply) or at timed intervals (e.g. daily reminder bot)

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Wes Bos Beginner JavaScript](https://wesbos.com/javascript/) - This is the best course in JavaScript I have taken in the past years, I keep returning to the notes time and time again.
